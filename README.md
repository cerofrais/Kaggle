# Kaggle accident level prediction problem
Accident level prediction based on categorical features


Most of the data is categorical so I tried to use decision tress and random forests.
Tried to do some feature engineering.
Tried different variations in feature engineering like : one hot encoding, removing features based on variance...


I have 10 -15 variantions of these files with different hyperparameters tuning. 

Final accuracy i could get is around 92%
